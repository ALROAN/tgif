        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
            transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's
            obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of
            how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF
            we believe that government should be transparent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials
            conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money must be readily
            available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and
            just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides
            information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
          </p>

            We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
            engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves the
            quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
            and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
            knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged
            in American government.

            TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can
            readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify
            information of greatest use to the public.

          <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
          <p>
            In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
            scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to
            the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack
            on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their
            intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments
            to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for
            example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
            territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its
            constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and
            that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent
            historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.
          </p>

          <p>
            Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America
            (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions
            and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the
            press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century,
            attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures
            were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians
            and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
            democratic practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of
            information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have
            adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the
            origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and
            Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining
            independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official
            Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).
          </p>

          <p>
            The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in
            1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws
            were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
